# Math Gestures with AI Assistance

This project is a gesture-based application that uses hand gestures to solve mathematical problems with the help of AI. The system captures hand gestures via a webcam and interacts with the user in real-time, allowing them to draw on a virtual canvas and process math problems.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Detects hand gestures using `cvzone` and `OpenCV`.
- **AI Integration**: Interacts with Google Generative AI (Gemini) to solve math problems drawn on the canvas.
- **Live Video Feed**: Displays real-time video feed with an overlaid virtual drawing canvas.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- Streamlit
- Google Generative AI
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-gestures.git
